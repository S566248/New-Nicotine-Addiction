# Nicotine Addiction and E-Cig/Vape Influence Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the influence of e-cigarettes and vapes on nicotine addiction rates. With the rise of e-cig and vape sales, especially among young adults, this study aims to analyze how these products impact nicotine addiction trends. Additionally, we will use machine learning to predict future addiction rates based on current data trends, providing valuable insights into the public health impact of e-cigarettes and vapes.

## Project Goals
1. Investigate the correlation between e-cig/vape presence and nicotine addiction rates.
2. Predict future nicotine addiction trends using machine learning models.
3. Visualize the impact of e-cigarette and vape sales on public health.

## Domain
**Nicotine addiction and e-cig/vape influence**  
This domain is of interest due to the increasing popularity of e-cigs and vapes and their potential long-term impact on nicotine dependency among different age groups. This project aims to provide insights that could inform public health policies and educational efforts.

## Data Sources
- **Primary Sources**: Kaggle (for related datasets)
- **Secondary Sources**: Sales data from vape and e-cig companies (if accessible)

## Data Problem
The central data problem is to analyze how the presence of e-cigs and vapes has affected nicotine addiction rates. This is both interesting and important, as it addresses public health concerns and helps forecast potential future trends in nicotine dependency.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Machine Learning**: A predictive analysis model will be used to project future nicotine addiction trends, considering current data. This approach will allow us to anticipate how addiction rates might evolve.
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau and Excel will be used for data visualization, helping to present trends and findings in an understandable format.

## Project Phases
1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly outline research questions and objectives.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather datasets from Kaggle and relevant sales data.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Process and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
4. **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyze initial trends and correlations in the data.
5. **Model Building**: Create predictive models to project future addiction rates.
6. **Validation**: Evaluate model performance to ensure accuracy.
7. **Implementation**: Generate visualizations and reports to communicate findings.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Understand the impact of e-cigarettes and vapes on nicotine addiction.
2. Predict how nicotine addiction trends may change in the coming years.
3. Provide a visual representation of these trends for easier understanding by stakeholders.

## Dependencies
- **Python** (for data cleaning and model building)
